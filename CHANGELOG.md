## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **24 feature modules** migrated to standalone, feature-gated architecture:
  - `pool-modes` - Session, Transaction, and Statement connection pooling
  - `ha-tr` - Transaction Replay with failover replay, cursor restore, session migration
  - `query-cache` - Multi-tier caching (L1 hot / L2 warm / L3 semantic)
  - `routing-hints` - SQL comment-based query routing (`/*helios:route=primary*/`)
  - `lag-routing` - Replica lag-aware routing with read-your-writes consistency
  - `rate-limiting` - Token bucket, sliding window, and concurrency limiters
  - `circuit-breaker` - Adaptive circuit breaker with sliding counter
  - `query-analytics` - Slow query log, N+1 detection, query fingerprinting
  - `multi-tenancy` - Tenant isolation with per-tenant connection pools
  - `auth-proxy` - JWT, OAuth, and API key authentication
  - `query-rewriting` - SQL rewriting rules engine
  - `wasm-plugins` - Hot-reload WASM plugin system (sandboxed)
  - `graphql-gateway` - GraphQL-to-SQL translation with introspection
  - `schema-routing` - Data temperature and workload classification routing
  - `distribcache` - Distributed intelligent caching with AI-driven prefetch
  - `observability` - Prometheus metrics and OpenTelemetry tracing
- **TopologyProvider trait** with two implementations:
  - `postgres-topology` - PostgreSQL discovery via `pg_is_in_recovery()` polling
  - `heliosdb-topology` - HeliosDB-Lite internal topology
- **`all-features` bundle** for enabling all proxy features at once
- PostgreSQL wire protocol forwarding with Transparent Write Routing (TWR)
- Request pipelining support (Parse/Bind/Execute pipeline, FIFO ordering)
- Batch INSERT coalescing for bulk write optimization
- Switchover buffer for zero-downtime planned failover
- Primary tracker with standalone and integrated modes
- Admin REST API with HTTP SQL endpoint for load-balanced queries
- Criterion benchmarks for pooling and routing performance
- Integration test skeleton for end-to-end verification
- CI workflow with feature matrix (default, ha-tr, all-features, all-features+postgres-topology)
- MSRV verification at Rust 1.75
- Release workflow for cross-platform binary builds (linux/macOS, x86_64/aarch64)
- Docker workflow with multi-arch images (amd64/arm64) pushed to GHCR

### Changed
- Restructured from embedded library to standalone binary + library crate
- All feature modules are now independently toggleable via Cargo feature flags
- Connection pool modes (`session`, `transaction`, `statement`) moved behind `pool-modes` feature

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- Connection pooling with Session, Transaction, and Statement modes
- Pool hardening: transaction leak detection, stale lease cleanup, exhaustion monitoring
- Prepared statement tracking across pool mode transitions
- Connection reset executor for clean state between leases
- Load balancer with round-robin, least-connections, and latency-based strategies
- Health checker with configurable check queries and failure thresholds
- Failover controller with sync-standby preference and automatic promotion
- Transaction journal for write tracking and replay

### Changed
- Upgraded to tokio 1.x full runtime
- Improved protocol codec for better PostgreSQL compatibility

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- Initial release of HeliosProxy as a standalone connection router
- PostgreSQL wire protocol support (startup, simple query, extended query)
- Basic connection pooling with configurable min/max connections
- Read/write splitting with automatic query classification
- Node health monitoring with configurable intervals and thresholds
- Admin API for runtime management and metrics
- Configuration via TOML file or command-line arguments
- Benchmark suite: HeliosProxy vs PgBouncer scalability comparison
- Docker support for containerized deployment
